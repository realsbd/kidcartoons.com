                                        away. I believe utitlies of the Cliff Hanger NFTs will excite 
                                        people who mint one and this will greatly help organically build

                                        YOU CAN HELP! Once you mint a Cliff hanger 
                                        NFT, this project becomes yours as well. 
                                        You can help me grow The Kid Tunes Discord server by doing 
                                        the same things I’m doing, sharing with friends and familiy, 
                                        creating marketing/promotional material and adding it to the 
                                        #growing-together channel, offering advertising help, etc.

                                        Remember - the utility that will make Cliff Hanger and the 
                                        rest of The Kid Toons NFT projects the strongest is simply 
                                        being a part of the The Kid Toons community. If we can work 
                                        together and spread awareness, the community itself will 
                                        become the most important utility.

                                        if we are able to mint all $10,000 NFTs. 
                                        The costs for priting and shipping $10,000 
                                        individual prints can become very expensive. 
                                        This is why this is dependent on selling out the mint.

                                        Once the mint sells out, I will begin priting 
                                        and shipping each unique NFT to its owner.
